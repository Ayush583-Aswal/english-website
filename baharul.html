		<h1>The Importance of Mediation in Achieving Peaceful Resolution of Conflicts</h1>
		<div class="byline">By Baharul Islam</div>

		<p>
            Conflict is a part of human life and it can arise in very form such as disagreements between groups,
individuals, countries etc. It is very harmful for one's growth. It may lead to clashes and may finally
turn into war. So it is very essential to find peaceful solutions to resolve those conflicts to avoid
violence and destructive consequences. Here comes the role of mediation. It is a very powerful tool
that help parties or groups to resolve their conflicts and reach mutually acceptable solutions. The
mediator does not decide the outcome, but helps the parties understand and focus on the important
issues needed to reach a resolution. Since both the parties mostly listen to the mediator so it
becomes easy to resolve the conflicts.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            Mediation is a process where a neutral third party helps reach an agreement through
communication. It is more constructive way of solving conflicts. In mediation parties work together
as a team and try to find solutions and methods that works for everyone, which leads to better
relationships among those conflicting parties. Furthermore, mediation is less expensive and fast
process than the process of taking legal actions, which can save parties lots of time and money.
In my opinion, mediation is a very crucial process for resolving conflicts and it should be used most
widely. In real world we see so many examples where conflicts had been solved by mediation.
These real life examples show that mediation is not only a theoretical concept but in reality it works
well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the real life examples have given below:
        </p>

                <li>
                    <p><i>
                        The Oslo Accords is one of the most significant example where the effectiveness of mediation in
resolving conflicts can be seen. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were signed between Israel and Palestine,
facilitated by the US. The agreement was reached through a series of discussions. This was done
with the help of a third party, Norway. The Oslo Accords was a very significant step towards
achieving peace between those two nations. The agreement was passed through many constructive
dialogue and negotiations and all these allowed both the sides to find common ground and reach
mutually acceptable solutions.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>
                        Another significant example of the effectiveness of mediation is the end of apartheid in South
Africa. In 1990, the South African government released Nelson Mandela, who had been imprisoned
for 27 years, and began negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC) to end apartheid.
The negotiations were facilitated by a mediator, and they resulted in the establishment of a
democratic government in South Africa This outcome was achieved through constructive dialogue
and negotiation, which allowed both sides to find common ground and reach mutually acceptable
solutions.

            </ul>
            <p>In conclusion, mediation is an essential tool for achieving peaceful resolution of conflicts. Realworld examples demonstrate the effectiveness of mediation in resolving conflicts, promoting
                constructive dialogue and negotiation. Mediation can also help preserve relationships that may be
                lost through legal processes. Conflicts will continue to arise, but mediation can help parties
                involved find common ground and reach mutually acceptable solutions that will lead to better longterm relationships.</p>
