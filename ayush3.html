		<h1>Role Of International Organisations</h1>
		<div class="byline">By Ayush Kumar Singh</div>
		<hr>
		<p>When it comes to conflict prevention and mediation then there is no other better option other than raising the issue at international platforms.The reason behind this is that these organizations are not biased, the reason behind their unbiasedness is that they are comprised of multiple countries, and the opinion of one country varies from others.</p>
		
		<p>These international organizations can be categorized into two categories:
            <ol>
                <li><h2>Intergovernmental organisation:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>UNO(united nation organisation)</li>
                        <li>FATF(financial action task force)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are many more examples but they are not relevant to our topics as they are not directly involved in conflict prevention and mediation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Military alliances:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NATO(North Atlantic treaty organisations)</li>
                        <li>QUAD </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>NOW WE WILL DISCUSS IN DETAIL HOW THESE ORGANISATIONS CAN HELP IN CONFLICT PREVENTION AND MEDICATION:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><h2>Intergovernmental organization:</h2>
                    <p>An intergovernmental organization like the United Nations (UN) plays a vital role in conflict prevention by promoting peace, security, and stability around the world. 
                    Whenever there are some conflicts going on in the world the UN takes swift action and initiates the discussion over the issue over which the conflict started. Initially UN try to initiate peace talks between the countries which are directly involved in the conflict. The UN facilitates peace negotiations and mediates disputes between conflicting parties. Additionally, the UN can deploy peacekeeping missions to help maintain ceasefire agreements and stabilize volatile situations.</p>
                    <p>
                        Examples:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li><i>
                                    Resolution of Iraq-Iran conflict(1980-1988):- In 1980, Saddam Hussein(dictator of Iraq ) invaded Iran and in response, Iranian troops also retaliated due to which conflict between these two countries escalated beyond the military level and it started affecting common people. This war continued in 1988 until the united nation peep into the matter and initiated the peace talks between the two countries and also ordered both countries to revert back to their original positions. Also, un deployed united nation peacekeepers to supervise the whole situation. Finely in 1988, peace was established between the two countries due to the efforts of the united nations.<br>

                                    Resolution of Greece-Turkey conflict(1994)In 1994, the UN helped prevent a major war between Greece and Turkey over the disputed island of Imia in the Aegean Sea. The UN-facilitated negotiations between the two countries and helped establish a demilitarized zone on the island, which prevented further conflict.<br>

                                    Resolution of Cuban Missile Crisis:- In 1962 the whole world was under the threat of the detonation of a nuclear bomb either by the USA or by USSR as there was a race going on between these countries to terrorize others with their nukes. The USA deployed its nukes in Turkey and in response to this USSR also deployed its nukes in Cuba. After seeing the equation between these two countries the united nations get involved in the matter and initiate peace talks to calm down the situation and it eventually leads to a peaceful resolution of the crisis.<br>

                    <h2>Military alliances:</h2>
                    <p>Military alliances can help in conflict prevention by creating a deterrent effect, where potential aggressors are deterred from initiating an attack due to the risk of facing a collective defense response from multiple allied nations. Additionally, military alliances can provide a framework for diplomatic communication and conflict resolution, as member countries may have established channels for dialogue and dispute resolution. By working together and building trust, military alliances can also promote stability and security in regions where tensions or disputes may exist.

                                    Mediation in The Bosnian war(1992-1995): In the early 1990s, the breakup of Yugoslavia led to the Bosnia war. As in Yugoslavia, the main and powerful organizations were occupied by Serbians and they didnâ€™t want the separation of another important piece of land of Bosnia where Muslims were in majority. This also includes the bloody Bosnian genocide where 18000 people lost their lives. After seeing such a barbaric massacre NATO intervened in the conflict and played a key role in resolving the conflict, including through the use of military force, with a NATO-led air campaign in 1995 contributing to a peace agreement later that year.

Finally, by the end of 1991, the NATO forces were able to eradicate the turmoil and established peace in the country.
