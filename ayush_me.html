		<h1>Use of human rights based apporaches and conflict prevention</h1>
		<div class="byline">By Ayush Aswal</div>
		<hr>
		<p>The use of human rights-based approaches is increasingly recognized as a valuable tool in conflict prevention and mediation efforts. Human rights provide a framework for understanding the underlying causes of conflict, including discrimination, inequality, and marginalization. By addressing these root causes, human rights-based approaches can help prevent conflicts from escalating and contribute to sustainable peace.It is important to make sure that the people affected by the conflict are involved in the process and their needs and opinions are taken into account.
        </p>
		<p>
            One key benefit of using human rights-based approaches in conflict prevention and mediation is that it can help to identify and address the problems of marginalized groups. For example, discrimination against ethnic or religious minorities, or denial of basic economic or social rights, can be significant drivers of conflict.
some past examples related to this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Naga Insurgency:</h2>
               <p> <i>The conflict began in the 1950s. It was started by the local naga tribes of Nagaland as they were deprived from their local cultural rights for a long time which eventually leads to the voilent protest 			for their rights. The Indian government has attempted to address the grievances of the Naga people through a series of negotiations and agreements, but the situation remains complex and unresolved.
            </i></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>LTTE revolt (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam):</h2>
                <p><i>LTTE was a militant group that operated in Sri Lanka from 1976 to 2009. The LTTE was fighting for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka, citing discrimination against Tamils by the majority Sinhalese government. It leds to a 3-decade long civil war.</i></p>
                <p><i>In the aftermath of the war, there have been efforts to promote reconciliation between Tamils and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka. However, progress has been slow, and allegations of human rights abuses by both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE continue to be a matter of concern.</i></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By addressing these underlying issues, human rights-based approaches can help to prevent conflicts from arising.</p>
        <p>In addition, human rights-based approaches can help make sure that when we try to stop conflicts and make peace, we focus on what the people and communities affected really need and think. This can make people trust us more and make peace agreements last longer.</p>
        <p>However, there are also challenges and limitations to using human rights-based approaches in conflict prevention and mediation. One challenge is that human rights-based approaches can be perceived as overly focused on legalistic and procedural issues, which may not always resonate with local cultures and traditions. In addition, human rights-based approaches can be difficult to implement in contexts where there is little respect for human rights or where human rights are not seen as relevant.</p>
        <p>To address these challenges, it is important to ensure that human rights-based approaches are integrated into broader conflict prevention and mediation strategies. This may involve working closely with local communities and civil society organizations, and adapting approaches to local contexts and cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, human rights-based approaches can help to create sustainable peace. When human rights are respected, protected, and promoted, it creates an environment of trust and mutual respect. This can lead to the development of a society that is less likely to lead to violence in the face of conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, human rights-based approaches and conflict prevention strategies are interconnected. By prioritizing human rights in conflict prevention and mediation, it is possible to create a more peaceful society. Human rights can serve as a guide for decision-making, and by promoting participation and empowerment, it is possible to create a sustainable peace that protects the rights of all members of society.
