		<h1>Other Countries as a Mediator</h1>
		<div class="byline">-By Barsing Samarth Shashikant</div>

        <h2>What is a mediator and who is a mediator?</h2>
		<p>
            Mediator is a source of establishing and securing mediation. The main role of mediator is to maintain mediation/peace between the domains in action of not valuing the importance of peace. It helps to settle a dispute or create agreement when there is a conflict between parties [countries].
        </p>
		<p>
            In similar way there take place many violating actions on international and national levels. To avoid such violation, mediator plays an important role.
These mediators work by assisting the parties through a discussion process with the objective of helping them find that settlements at the end and meet their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mediators work in stages. These stages are:<br>
            <ol>
                <li><i>
                    Opening statements. </i>
                </li>
                <li><i>Joint discussions.</i></li>
                <li>
                    <i>Private discussions. </i>
                </li>
                <li><i>Negotiation.</i></li>
                <li><i>Settlements.</i></li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some countries who have mediation laws. A law with a neutral intermediary, who helps the parties to reach a mutual satisfactory settlements of their dispute is called mediation law. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of these developed small economies also have taken on a neutral status in international relations that enabled them to become credible mediators in key international disputes. In particular, Austria and Switzerland have the principle of neutrality enshrined in their Constitution. In the case of Austria the Declaration of Neutrality was enacted in 1955 as a constitutional act of parliament. In Switzerland neutrality as a foreign policy norm was included into the Constitutions of 1848, 1874 and 1999 and also featured in the country's accession statement to the United Nations in 2002.

            In Singapore neutrality has been pronounced as a de facto key foreign policy orientation, most notably with respect to the competitive tensions between the US and China in the South East Asia regions. Due to these strong de facto neutrality credentials Singapore was able to serve as venue for talks and negotiations between the US and North Korea in 2018 as well as between China’s leader Xi Jinping and Taiwan’s leader Ma Ying-Jeou in 2015. In the words of Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, when it comes to the country's foreign policy and its efforts be a credible and consistent partner, “the key to this is our neutrality… We will be nobody’s stooge, we will not act on behalf of any other power” We cannot be bought, nor can we be bullied”. It is this neutrality that enables Singapore to expand the network of alliances in the world economy and to raise its weight in international affairs. Back in 2009 the architect of Singapore’s modernization Lee Kuan Yew observed: “Small countries have little power to alter the region. A small country must seek a maximum number of friends, while maintaining the freedom to be itself as a sovereign and independent nation. We must make ourselves relevant so that other countries have an interest in our continued survival and prosperity as a sovereign and independent nation.”
The United Arab Emirates has also significantly increased its peace-making efforts in recent years, with the Emirates brokering negotiations between Pakistan and India that resulted in their declaration that they would respect the 2003 cease-fire accord. Earlier in 2018 the UAE together with Saudi Arabia played a key role in mediating the 2018 peace agreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia. In 2020 Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed played a key role in the attainment of the Abraham accords between Israel and several Arab states. The UAE is also seeking diplomatic solutions to tensions around countries such as Syria, Libya and Yemen.  
        </p>
        <p>There are many countries who have small economics, but they possess a higher role in negotiating between the parties. The potential for such small countries to successfully mediate conflicts is further magnified in case they are able to bring on board regional organizations that they are an important part of.

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>
                Till date these wars are taking place as there are some countries who are not accepting to meet their needs. Hence to avoid these wars and meet the needs of other countries, there exist the mediators. Hence they play a role to maintain peace in the world.</p>
